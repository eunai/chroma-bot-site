# Lexa Bot Website

Started learning about HTML and CSS back on August  20, 2020.

This is my work from the progress I'm making. Mainly a website for Lexa bot on Discord.

Slowly learning Javascript as well.

I'm going to be continuously updating as well as learning new things to implement, replace, and/or improve.
